# **COURSE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM**

1. Objective:  This project builds a recommender system that provides course recommendations to the visitors on the website. Recommender systems are gaining significance with the increasing trend of online learning opportunities to attract more dollars for companies while at the same time saving time for the students/learners by providing suggestions on similar courses that they might be interested in. This lso increases the importance of having robust systems that provide accurate suggestions as each wrong suggestion can result in revenue loss to the company and loss of trust on the suggestions. 


2. Solution and Approach: In this project, I have implemented a basic system using the content based appoach as the dataset that we acquired had details of the courses and we don't have the reveiews on the courses so that limits us from using Collaborative filtering technique. Data was acquired using web scrapping (with the help of BeautifulSoup). And we used a similarty method to then suggest top 5 most similar courses to the visitors.
