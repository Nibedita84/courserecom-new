The main concern with these logistics companies is trying to deliver these goods in an efficient and cost-efficient way possible, so the pricing of the shipment is tricky and involves a lot of variables to consider while the pricing of the shipment. There might be scenarios where the shipment might be delayed due to some external reasons, leading to a loss for the company and a delay in delivery of the shipment. So logistics companies need to use dynamic pricing based on several factors and variables to price the shipment in such a way that there are no losses to the company and the price of the shipment is as less as possible so that customers can use their services more due to effective pricing rates.","{'IN': 17700, 'US': 240, 'isFree': False}",,"{'startDate': ""3rd Jan'23"", 'timings': 'Flexible'}",[],2022-12-08T09:10:15.511Z,6391a9f7e714c07d825318e2.jpg,"[{'instructors': ['622603d5760e3e0aa5f854af'], 'overview': {'learn': ['Real Time Projects', 'Shipment Price Prediction', 'Learn about Regression model implementation', 'Hyperparameter optimization', 'How to work with database', 'Modular coding approach for training and prediction pipeline along with FastAPI ', 'Learn about AWS basics ', 'CICD tools like Github actions ', 'Production-grade deployment'], 'requirements': ['System with minimum i3 processor or better', 'At least 4 GB of RAM', 'Working internet connection', 'Dedication to learn'], 'features': ['Do Everything In Industry Grade Lab', 'Learn As Per Your Timeline', 'Hands-On Industry Real-Time Projects.', 'Self Paced Learning', 'Dashboard Access', 'Course Materials', 'Assignments'], 'language': 'english'}}]","[{'_id': '622603d5760e3e0aa5f854af', 'name': 'Boktiar Ahmed Bappy', 'description': ""This is Bappy.
